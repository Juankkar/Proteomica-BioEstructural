Computing secondary structure assignments for model(s) #0, #1
using ksdssp (Kabsch and Sander Define Secondary Structure
of Proteins) with the parameters:
  energy cutoff -0.5
  minimum helix length 3
  minimum strand length 3

Matchmaker 3hrw.pdb, chain A (#0) with 1y8i.pdb, chain A (#1), sequence alignment score = 596
with these parameters:
	chain pairing: sb
	Needleman-Wunsch using BLOSUM-62
	ss fraction: 0.3
	gap open (HH/SS/other) 18/18/6, extend 1
	ss matrix:  (O, S): -6 (H, O): -6 (H, H): 6 (S, S): 6 (H, S): -9 (O, O): 4
	iteration cutoff: 2
RMSD between 138 pruned atom pairs is 0.701 angstroms; (across all 141 pairs: 1.251)
